# SQL-Books-Analysis
This project focuses on building and analyzing a relational database for a  bookstore. The primary objective is to simulate a real-world retail environment and perform data analysis using structured query language (SQL). It demonstrates how data-driven insights can be extracted from raw transactional data to support business decision-making.The goal was to simulate a real-world retail environment where books are sold to customers through orders.

The project begins by creating a normalized database with three interconnected tables:

Books: Stores detailed information about each book, such as its title, author, genre, price, publication year, and available stock.

Customers: Holds customer profiles including name, location, and contact information.

Orders: Records transaction data, linking customers and books, along with order dates, quantities, and total amounts spent.
